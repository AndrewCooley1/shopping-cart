## Installation:

Please download or fork the following (https://github.com/prof-rossetti/intro-to-python/tree/main/projects/shopping-cart), and then move into the project repository. 


## Evironment Setup:

Use Anaconda to create and activate a new virtual environment, perhaps called "Shopping_env:

conda create -n shopping_env python=3.8 

Please then activate this virtual environment

conda activate shopping_env

After activating the virtual environment, install package dependencies (see the "requirements.txt" file):

pip install -r requirements.txt

## Set Up and Tax:

 In the root directory of your local repository, create a new file called ".env", and update the contents of the ".env" file so that "tax_rate = .0875" (then make sure to SAVE the ".env" file aftwards):

 .0875 is the default New York State tax rate.  Please feel free to change the tax rate to any other applicable rate required locally if you so chose. 


## To Run the Program:

Execute the following command to run the program. 

Python Shopping_cart.py

Input each products ID numbers one at a time (between 1 and 20). When completed type "DONE" and the program will process a receipt for you of the Subtotal, Tax and Total of the transaction.
